				<h3>Welcome to the Additive Design and Manufacturing Lab</h3>
				<div>
					Here at ADML, we mainly focus on researching Additive Manufacturing (AM) and related technologies.
					ADML is affiliated with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at McGill University in Montréal, Québec, Canada.
					A team of graduate and undergraduate students led by a professor who specializes in design and manufacturing research is working on cutting-edge technologies and research projects.
					This is possible thanks to our numerous sponsors and partners both within the faculty and from industries throughout the world.
